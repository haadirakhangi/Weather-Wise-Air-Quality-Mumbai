# WeatherAQI-Analysis-Mumbai
The project aims to study the impact of various weather parameters on air quality in the city of Mumbai, India. Mumbai is a densely populated and highly polluted city, with air pollution being a major health concern for its residents. This project focuses on exploring how different weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and solar radiation, affect air quality in the city.

The project starts with collecting and processing weather data from various sources, including government agencies and weather stations. The collected data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis, using data wrangling techniques such as handling missing data, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

After data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed on the weather data to gain insights into the distribution, correlation, and trends of different weather parameters over time. Data visualization tools, such as charts, graphs, and maps, are used to represent the data in an intuitive and meaningful way.

The next stage of the project involves building machine learning models to predict the AQI (Air Quality Index) of PM2.5, CO, and SO2 based on the weather parameters. Various machine learning algorithms, such as random forest regressor(for AQI), naive bayes classifier and decision tree (for 'conditions') and linear regression (for both), are tested and compared to identify the most accurate model

The results of the analysis concludes that the weather conditions are most strongly associated with air pollution in Mumbai and hence it is difficult to predict it with the weather parameters that are used.

In summary, this project showcases the use of data science techniques, including EDA and machine learning, to understand and predict the impact of weather parameters on air quality in a highly polluted city.
